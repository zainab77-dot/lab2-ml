## Machine Learning Problem

### Problem Type
Supervised Learning – Classification

### Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to formulate a supervised classification problem that predicts whether a student is experiencing a mental health condition (such as depression, anxiety, or panic attacks) based on their demographic and academic information, including age, gender, course, year of study, and CGPA. By learning the relationship between these features and mental health outcomes, the model can help identify important factors associated with students’ mental well-being and support early detection and intervention.
